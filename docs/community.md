## About mSCP

MACE is built on top of the [macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP)](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security), created and maintained by federal government Mac admins at NIST. All the rules, frameworks, and compliance logic come directly from mSCP.

## About the Developer

MACE is developed by a Mac admin who wanted a better way to work with mSCP. What started as a personal tool to avoid bouncing between terminal windows and YAML files became something worth sharing.

Built in Swift and SwiftUI. No tracking, no telemetry, no accounts. Just a tool that does what it says.
